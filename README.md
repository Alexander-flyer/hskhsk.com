## [Hanzi Graphs](hanzigraphs)

The source files that I used to create the Chinese Vocabulary Graphs at https://hskhsk.com/graphs - words with common characters are connected in most graphs, in some characters with common components are connected, and in others words are arranged by HSK level and frequency.

## [Chinese-English Dictionary and other Tools](cidian)
A set of tools collected together that are useful for manipulating Chinese vocabulary lists. The dictionary allows you to navigate between related characters, showing all word compounds, sub-components, etc. There are also compact HSK 1-6 lists, an advanced search function, and some generic set operations (that work in any language) for comparing vocabulary lists.

This HTML5 mobile web app got quite advanced and allowed users to study the built in or their own flashcards. Several skills were studied including reading and writing hanzi characters, and learning their English definitions. Itve fea had some quite innovative features, and I may pick it up again some day althoughiI would build it in a much more advanced online/offline development environments such as Google Cloud's Firebase.
